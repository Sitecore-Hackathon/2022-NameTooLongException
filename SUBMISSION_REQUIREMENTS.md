# Entry Submission Requirements
All teams are required to submit the following as part of their entry submission no later than the end of the Hackathon on Saturday March 6th, 2021 at 8 PM EST. The submitted module shall be based on Sitecore 10.1 XM or XP. Due to the complexity of Commerce, no submissions for Commerce will be accepted.

## Sitecore Setup
The choice is yours as to how you install Sitecore locally for the Hackathon. There is no requirement on whether you setup with Docker, SIF/SIA, Sifon, SIFless, SIM, or [insert creative approach]. We do however require that the installation steps are simple, few, and require no magic to get your submission working. We encourage you to perform a fresh install and follow your own documentation to ensure that no steps are missed. It would be unwise to try any of these installation methods for the first time the day of the Hackathon because so much can go wrong; do what you know well and invest as much time as you can being creative working on your solution.

For those with prior experience working with Docker, we have provided a ["starter kit"](STARTERKIT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) in this GitHub repository (thanks Anders) with a variety of options to speed things up. 

## Deliverables
Please read carefully -- and thoroughly -- to ensure you have not missed any of the requirements.

### The Module
The module has to be based on [**Sitecore 10.1**](https://dev.sitecore.net/Downloads/Sitecore_Experience_Platform/101/Sitecore_Experience_Platform_101.aspx)

Since the installation of your module should be simple, we recommend you follow one of these approaches:
- Sitecore module package (.zip)
- Sitecore web deploy package (.scwdp.zip) with automated install
- Simple Visual Studio deploy with SCS/Unicorn sync

**Note:** Please do not require the use of Sitecore Rocks or TDS to build and deploy the solution. Any one of the judges or community members reviewing your solution may not have those tools installed.

### Code
Notwithstanding the fact that value full creativity in your submission, we are going to be judgy here -- we are judges, after all. Once your code is pushed to GitHub, we will look for the following with no exceptions:
- Cleanliness of code
- Clear documentation
- Adherence to Sitecore best practices (Helix)

### Documentation
The documentation requirements are extremely important. If the judges are unable to get your Hackathon project running then we can't count it as complete. Here are items we expect to be included which must be pushed to the GitHub repo in the readme:
- One to two pages of documentation describing your module's purpose with screenshots of the finished product 
- Installation steps with screenshots where appropriate
- Short YouTube video describing your module's purpose, setup instructions, and how to use it

__Read and follow the instructions in__ [ENTRYFORM](ENTRYFORM.md)

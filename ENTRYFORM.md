You can find a very good reference to Github flavoured markdown reference in [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). If you want something a bit more WYSIWYG for editing then could use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app) which provides a more user friendly interface for generating the Markdown code. Those of you who are [VS Code fans](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview) can edit/preview directly in that interface too.

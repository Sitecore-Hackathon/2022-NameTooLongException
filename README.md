Best addition to the Sitecore MVP site

## Description
Our addition to the MVP site is client-side personalization based on configuration contributed in Sitecore.
We all know the Sitecore personalization engine might be a bit slow from time to time. If your frontend is relying on a direct connection to the Layout Service, you will still notice this performance impact when personalization is used heavily in the site. Sitecore performs best when everything can be cached, which simply can't be done when a component/page is personalized.
[Traditional Personalization](docs/images/personalization-normal.png?raw=true "Traditional Personalization")
To mitigate this, we moved the personalization engine to the 'client-side'. Instead of Sitecore evaluating all the conditions and returning the correct variant of a rendering, we want to return all variants as part of the JSON response from the Layout Service. This way we can make Sitecore always cache the JSON response, even when personalization has been applied.
[Client-side Personalization](docs/images/personalization-clientside.png?raw=true "Client-side Personalization")
Within the Rendering Host we then evaluate all the variants (if applicable) and only return one of the variants to the parts of the Rendering Engine which actually render the components. The components themselves don't know anything about what happened, they just receive a single object with content to display.

Next to the fact that this brings performance improvements to the Sitecore platform, this setup will also make personalization possible when using Experience Edge. Normally, when using Experience Edge, Sitecore is only able to push items to Experience Edge which are then stored and served when requested. When the frontend application requests a page from Experience Edge, there is no callback happening to Sitecore to evaluate any kind of personalization rules.
By adding all variants to the item pushed to Experience Edge, we can again trigger personalization rules to be evaluated in the frontend application instead. This way it is possible to use personalization when using Experience Edge!
[Experience Edge Personalization](docs/images/personalization-edge.png?raw=true "Experience Edge Personalization")

To demonstrate that this works, we implemented 4 different rules:
1. Day of Week; an OOTB Sitecore rule which checks the current day of the week against a provided list
2. Month of Year; an OOTB Sitecore rule which checks the current month against a provided list
3. Page visited; a rule integrated with Sitecore CDP/Personalize which triggers an Decision Model in Personalize to see if the current visitor has visited a specific page
4. Form submitted; a rule integrated with Sitecore Send which checks if the visitor has submitted a form (inserted from Sitecore Send) on the site

## Video link

## Pre-requisites and Dependencies
As this is an addition to the MVP site, the changes have been added to the MVP solution. This means the pre-requisites are exactly the same as used in the MVP site today.

- [.NET Core (>= v 3.1) and .NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- Approx 40gb HD space
- [Okta Developer Account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/)
- Valid Sitecore license

## Installation instructions
As this is an addition to the MVP site, the changes have been added to the MVP solution. This means the installation process is exactly the same as used in the MVP site today.

1. 🏃‍♂️ Run the Start-Environment script from an _elevated_ PowerShell terminal 

    ```ps1
    .\Start-Environment -LicensePath "C:\path\to\license.xml"
    ```
   _Note:_  The LicensePath argument only has to be used on the initial run of the script. The license file must be named `license.xml`, the script copies it to the folder `.\docker\license` where it also can be placed or updated manually.  

   > You **must** use an elevated/Administrator PowerShell terminal  
   > [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases) looks best but the built-in Windows Powershell 5.1 terminal works too.

2. ☕ Follow the on screen instructions.  

   _Note:_ that you will be asked to fill in the following values with your Okta developer account details:
      - OKTA_DOMAIN (*must* include protocol, e.g. `OKTA_DOMAIN=https://dev-your-id.okta.com`)
      - OKTA_CLIENT_ID
      - OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET  
   [Sign up for an Okta Developer Account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/)

   _If the wizard is aborted prematurely or if the container build fails then use the `-InitializeEnvFile` switch to re-run the full wizard._

    ```ps1
    .\Start-Environment.ps1 -InitializeEnvFile
    ```  

3. 🔑 When prompted, log into Sitecore via your browser, and accept the device authorization.  

4. 🚀 Wait for the startup script to open a browser tab with the Sitecore Launchpad.  

5. 🛑 To Stop the environment again  
   
   ```ps1
   .\Stop-Environment.ps1
   ```  

### Configuration
⟹ If there are any custom configuration that has to be set manually then remember to add all details here.

_Remove this subsection if your entry does not require any configuration that is not fully covered in the installation instructions already_

## Usage instructions
⟹ Provide documentation about your module, how do the users use your module, where are things located, what do the icons mean, are there any secret shortcuts etc.

Include screenshots where necessary. You can add images to the `./images` folder and then link to them from your documentation:

You can embed images of different formats too:

![Deal With It](docs/images/deal-with-it.gif?raw=true "Deal With It")

And you can embed external images too:
